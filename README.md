In this paper, we present a novel conditional variational autoencoder based on Transformer for missing plot generation. Our model uses shared attention layers for encoder and decoder, which make the most of the contextual clues, and a latent variable for learning the distribution of coherent story plots. Through drawing samples from the learned distribution, diverse reasonable plots can be generated. Both automatic and manual evaluations show that our model generates better story plots than stateof-the-art models in terms of readability, diversity and coherence.</details> <details> <summary><mark><font color=darkred> abstract</font></mark></summary> </details>
